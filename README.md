# What's for Dinner

"What's for Dinner" is a fun and interactive React application that helps you make decisions when you're indecisive about what to have for your next meal, whether it's breakfast, lunch, or dinner. This app presents you with two random mealoptions, and you simply click on your preferred choice. The selected meal then competes against another random option, and the process repeats.

**Key Features:**

-   Get meal inspiration by comparing random food options.
-   Discover new recipes and cooking instructions when a meal is chosen five times consecutively.
-   Re-roll options if none of the presented meals appeal to you.
-   Access recipe and ingredient details at any point (in progress).
-   Filter food options by categories such as seafood, vegan, Italian, and more (in progress).
-   Exclude specific ingredients for allergies or personal preferences (in progress).
-   Include must-have ingredients for those craving something specific (in progress).
-   Explore a completely random food choice (in progress).


Whether you're looking for culinary adventure or a quick meal decision, "What's for Dinner" has you covered. Enjoy the excitement of culinary randomness and expand your meal repertoire today!

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
